The curriculum shaping future architects, visionaries, and practitioners, and the comprehensive programmes at GSA are approved by the Council of Architecture. In light of the sustainable development goals, technological advancements, exploding urbanisation and fast evolving climate change situation, the programme identifies the challenging playing field ahead for practitioners and encourages their understanding, analysis and response through design.</font>
